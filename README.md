# What is it?

> A tool to automate "Steam Client clean up", as described [here](https://forums.steamrep.com/threads/steam-client-clean-up.104175/).

- Deletes most of the Steam client installation files, but:

 - Will not delete the folders with your screenshots or installed apps & games.

 - Will not force you to login to Steam again.

 - Will not destroy the categories you've set for apps.

# Installation

## Windows

Download the latest SteamClientCleaner-v#.#.#-Setup.exe and install it.

## Mac

  Download the latest SteamClientCleaner-#.#.#.dmg, mount it, and then drag SteamClientCleaner.app to Applications.

# Usage

## Note

SCC does a lot of reading/writing. Using it on/from an SSD is not recommended.

Don't run SCC while Steam is running!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, make sure Steam is closed.

Press "Choose" and then find and select your Steam installation folder. If you're using the default Steam installation location it should be automatically selected. The default Steam installation location can also be viewed by going to the Help page.
